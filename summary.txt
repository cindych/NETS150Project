Project Name: OpenDataPhilly Search+
Project Members: Cindy Chen, Jada Harrison

Description: This program was made to help users search for datasets and retrieve information for 
             particular datasets on https://www.opendataphilly.org/, a catalog of data in the
             Philadelphia region to complement the existing built-in search functionality! 

             Its features, among others, include finding datasets created on a specific date, finding
             datasets with a specific keyword in its title, retrieving information about the 
             description and topics of a dataset, and retrieving information about the organization 
             of a dataset and all other datasets published by the organization. Detailed information 
             about the functionalities can be found in the user manual.

Categories: World Wide Web (WWW)
    -> We interacted directly with URLs and the World Wide Web, using JSoup and RegEx to parse and find HTML elements 
       in order to collect information (web scraping) as needed from https://www.opendataphilly.org/ for our functions.

Work Breakdown
    -> Jada: DatasetParser.java + DatasetParserMain.java
        - DatasetParser(), getLinkPage(), getLinkMap() - obtained from class files 
        - setLinkPage(), setTopicMap() - inspired by their equivalents obtained from class files 
        - Fully wrote all other DatasetParser.java methods 
        - Wrote corresponding method calls in DatasetParserMain.java for to test methods' functionality

    -> Cindy: DatasetParser2.java + DatasetParserMain.java
        - DataParser2(), makesTopicMap() - obtained from class files (slightly altered)
        - Fully wrote all other DatasetParser2.java methods, including helper methods
        - Wrote corresponding method calls in DatasetParserMain.java to test functionality of methods
