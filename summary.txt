Project Name: OpenDataPhilly Search+
Project Members: Cindy Chen, Jada Harrison

Description: OpenDataPhilly Search+ is a program that allows users to go deeper in their search of https://www.opendataphilly.org/. 
With OpenDataPhilly Search+, users are able to receive information in a more direct manner from the site in a variety
of ways rather than searching through the pages of the site. OpenDataPhilly Search+ goes through the pages' HTML to 
give the user more information about datasets, organizations, and even OpenDataPhilly itself. Some functionality requires
inputs and some don't. With OpenDataPhilly Search+, users are able to get even more specific categorization/information. 

Categories: World Wide Web (WWW)
    -> We interacted directly with URLs and the World Wide Web, using JSoup and RegEx to parse and find HTML elements 
       in order to collect information (web scraping) as needed from https://www.opendataphilly.org/ for our functions.

Work Breakdown
    -> Jada: DatasetParser.java + DatasetParserMain.java
        - DatasetParser(), getLinkPage(), getLinkMap() - obtained from class files 
        - setLinkPage(), setTopicMap() - inspired by their equivalents obtained from class files 
        - Fully wrote all other DatasetParser.java methods 
        - Wrote corresponding method calls in DatasetParserMain.java for to test methods' functionality

    -> Cindy: DatasetParser2.java + DatasetParserMain.java
        Aside from helper methods, implemented the following functions in DatasetParser2.java: 
        listSetsInTopic, findDescription, matchKeyword, matchKeywordUnderTopic, 
        findOrganizationAndPrintOthers
